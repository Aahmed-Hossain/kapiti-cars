## Design Explanation
- The invoice was always visible on the right side of the screen. By moving the invoice to a floating button on the bottom right, the main screen remains clean and focused on the products. Users can browse and select products without any distractions.
- The floating button gives users the control to view the invoice only when they need to. This on-demand visibility empowers user experiences.
-  When users are ready to review or confirm the invoice, they can simply click the floating button. This separation of tasks (browsing vs. reviewing) creates a more intuitive and enjoyable user journey.
- The design emphasizes user-centric design principles by prioritizing a clean interface, user control, and efficient use of screen space.
